Now, sir, young Fortinbras,\\nOf unimproved mettle hot and full,\\nHath in the skirts of Norway here and there\\nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise\\nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other--\\nAs it doth well appear unto our state--\\nBut to recover of us, by strong hand\\nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\\nSo by his father lost: and this, I take it,\\nIs the main motive of our preparations,\\nThe source of this our watch and the chief head\\nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\\nBERNARDO\\nI think it be no other but e'en so:\\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure\\nComes armed through our watch; so like the king\\nThat was and is the question of these wars.\\nHORATIO\\nA mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.\\nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell,\\nThe graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead\\nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:\\nAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\\nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands\\nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:\\nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events,\\nAs harbingers preceding still the fates\\nHAMLET - Act I\\n9And prologue to the omen coming on,\\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated\\nUnto our climatures and countrymen.--\\nBut soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!\\nRe-enter Ghost\\nI'll cross it, though it blast me.

But let me conjure you, by\\nthe rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of\\nour youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved\\nlove, and by what more dear a better proposer could\\ncharge you withal, be even and direct with me,\\nwhether you were sent for, or no?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nAside to GUILDENSTERN\\nWhat say you?\\nHAMLET\\nAside\\nHAMLET - Act II\\n50Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you\\nlove me, hold not off.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nMy lord, we were sent for.\\nHAMLET\\nI will tell you why; so shall my anticipation\\nprevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king\\nand queen moult no feather. I have of late--but\\nwherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all\\ncustom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily\\nwith my disposition that this goodly frame, the\\nearth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most\\nexcellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave\\no'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted\\nwith golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to\\nme than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.\\nWhat a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!\\nhow infinite in faculty! in form and moving how\\nexpress and admirable! in action how like an angel!\\nin apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the\\nworld! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,\\nwhat is this quintessence of dust? man delights not\\nme: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling\\nyou seem to say so.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nMy lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.\\nHAMLET\\nWhy did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nTo think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what\\nlenten entertainment the players shall receive from\\nyou: we coted them on the way; and hither are they\\ncoming, to offer you service.\\nHAMLET\\nHe that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty\\nshall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight\\nshall use his foil and target; the lover shall not\\nsigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part\\nin peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose\\nlungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall\\nsay her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt\\nfor't. What players are they?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nHAMLET - Act II\\n51Even those you were wont to take delight in, the\\ntragedians of the city.\\nHAMLET\\nHow chances it they travel? their residence, both\\nin reputation and profit, was better both ways.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nI think their inhibition comes by the means of the\\nlate innovation.\\nHAMLET\\nDo they hold the same estimation they did when I was\\nin the city? are they so followed?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nNo, indeed, are they not.\\nHAMLET\\nHow comes it? do they grow rusty?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nNay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but\\nthere is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,\\nthat cry out on the top of question, and are most\\ntyrannically clapped for't: these are now the\\nfashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they\\ncall them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of\\ngoose-quills and dare scarce come thither.\\nHAMLET\\nWhat, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are\\nthey escoted? Will they pursue the quality no\\nlonger than they can sing? will they not say\\nafterwards, if they should grow themselves to common\\nplayers--as it is most like, if their means are no\\nbetter--their writers do them wrong, to make them\\nexclaim against their own succession?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\n'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and\\nthe nation holds it no sin to tarre them to\\ncontroversy: there was, for a while, no money bid\\nfor argument, unless the poet and the player went to\\ncuffs in the question.\\nHAMLET\\nIs't possible?\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nHAMLET - Act II\\n52O, there has been much throwing about of brains.\\nHAMLET\\nDo the boys carry it away?\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nAy, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.\\nHAMLET\\nIt is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of\\nDenmark, and those that would make mows at him while\\nmy father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an\\nhundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.\\n'Sblood, there is something in this more than\\nnatural, if philosophy could find it out.\\nFlourish of trumpets within\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nThere are the players.\\nHAMLET\\nGentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,\\ncome then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion\\nand ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,\\nlest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,\\nmust show fairly outward, should more appear like\\nentertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my\\nuncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nIn what, my dear lord?\\nHAMLET\\nI am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is\\nsoutherly I know a hawk from a handsaw.\\nEnter POLONIUS\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nWell be with you, gentlemen!\\nHAMLET\\nHark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a\\nhearer: that great baby you see there is not yet\\nout of his swaddling-clouts.\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nHappily he's the second time come to them; for they\\nsay an old man is twice a child.\\nHAMLET\\nHAMLET - Act II\\n53I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;\\nmark it.

I am glad\\nto see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old\\nfriend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:\\ncomest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young\\nlady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is\\nnearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the\\naltitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like\\napiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the\\nring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en\\nto't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:\\nwe'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste\\nof your quality; come, a passionate speech.\\nFirst Player\\nWhat speech, my lord?\\nHAMLET\\nI heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was\\nnever acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the\\nplay, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas\\ncaviare to the general: but it was--as I received\\nit, and others, whose judgments in such matters\\ncried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well\\ndigested in the scenes, set down with as much\\nmodesty as cunning. I remember, one said there\\nwere no sallets in the lines to make the matter\\nsavoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might\\nindict the author of affectation; but called it an\\nhonest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very\\nmuch more handsome than fine. One speech in it I\\nchiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and\\nHAMLET - Act II\\n55thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of\\nPriam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin\\nat this line: let me see, let me see--\\n'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--\\nit is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--\\n'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,\\nBlack as his purpose, did the night resemble\\nWhen he lay couched in the ominous horse,\\nHath now this dread and black complexion smear'd\\nWith heraldry more dismal; head to foot\\nNow is he total gules; horridly trick'd\\nWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\\nBaked and impasted with the parching streets,\\nThat lend a tyrannous and damned light\\nTo their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,\\nAnd thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,\\nWith eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\\nOld grandsire Priam seeks.'\\nSo, proceed you.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\n'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and\\ngood discretion.\\nFirst Player\\n'Anon he finds him\\nStriking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,\\nRebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\\nRepugnant to command: unequal match'd,\\nPyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;\\nBut with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\\nThe unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\\nSeeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\\nStoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\\nTakes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,\\nWhich was declining on the milky head\\nOf reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:\\nSo, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,\\nAnd like a neutral to his will and matter,\\nDid nothing.\\nBut, as we often see, against some storm,\\nA silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\\nThe bold winds speechless and the orb below\\nAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\\nDoth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,\\nAroused vengeance sets him new a-work;\\nAnd never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\\nOn Mars's armour forged for proof eterne\\nWith less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\\nNow falls on Priam.\\nHAMLET - Act II\\n56Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,\\nIn general synod 'take away her power;\\nBreak all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\\nAnd bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\\nAs low as to the fiends!'\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThis is too long.\\nHAMLET\\nIt shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,\\nsay on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he\\nsleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.\\nFirst Player\\n'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'\\nHAMLET\\n'The mobled queen?'\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nThat's good; 'mobled queen' is good.\\nFirst Player\\n'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames\\nWith bisson rheum; a clout upon that head\\nWhere late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\\nAbout her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,\\nA blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;\\nWho this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,\\n'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have\\npronounced:\\nBut if the gods themselves did see her then\\nWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\\nIn mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,\\nThe instant burst of clamour that she made,\\nUnless things mortal move them not at all,\\nWould have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,\\nAnd passion in the gods.'\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nLook, whether he has not turned his colour and has\\ntears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.\\nHAMLET\\n'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.\\nGood my lord, will you see the players well\\nbestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for\\nthey are the abstract and brief chronicles of the\\ntime: after your death you were better have a bad\\nHAMLET - Act II\\n57epitaph than their ill report while you live.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nMy lord, I will use them according to their desert.\\nHAMLET\\nGod's bodykins, man, much better: use every man\\nafter his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?\\nUse them after your own honour and dignity: the less\\nthey deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.\\nTake them in.\\nLORD POLONIUS\\nCome, sirs.\\nHAMLET\\nFollow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.\\nExit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First\\nDost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the\\nMurder of Gonzago?\\nFirst Player\\nAy, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nWe'll ha't to-morrow night.

To die, to sleep;\\nTo sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;\\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come\\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\\nMust give us pause: there's the respect\\nThat makes calamity of so long life;\\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\\nThe oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\\nThe pangs of despised love, the law's delay,\\nThe insolence of office and the spurns\\nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,\\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\\nWith a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,\\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\\nBut that the dread of something after death,\\nThe undiscover'd country from whose bourn\\nNo traveller returns, puzzles the will\\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all;\\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\\nHAMLET - Act III\\n63Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment\\nWith this regard their currents turn awry,\\nAnd lose the name of action.--Soft you now!\\nThe fair Ophelia!

Now this overdone,\\nor come tardy off, though it make the unskilful\\nlaugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the\\ncensure of the which one must in your allowance\\no'erweigh a whole theatre of others.

The other motive,\\nWhy to a public count I might not go,\\nIs the great love the general gender bear him;\\nWho, dipping all his faults in their affection,\\nWould, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\\nHAMLET - Act IV\\n109Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,\\nToo slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,\\nWould have reverted to my bow again,\\nAnd not where I had aim'd them.\\nLAERTES\\nAnd so have I a noble father lost;\\nA sister driven into desperate terms,\\nWhose worth, if praises may go back again,\\nStood challenger on mount of all the age\\nFor her perfections: but my revenge will come.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nBreak not your sleeps for that: you must not think\\nThat we are made of stuff so flat and dull\\nThat we can let our beard be shook with danger\\nAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:\\nI loved your father, and we love ourself;\\nAnd that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--\\nEnter a Messenger\\nHow now! what news?\\nMessenger\\nLetters, my lord, from Hamlet:\\nThis to your majesty; this to the queen.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nFrom Hamlet! who brought them?\\nMessenger\\nSailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:\\nThey were given me by Claudio; he received them\\nOf him that brought them.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nLaertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.\\nExit Messenger\\nReads\\n'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on\\nyour kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see\\nyour kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your\\npardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden\\nand more strange return.

'Naked!\\nAnd in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'\\nCan you advise me?\\nLAERTES\\nI'm lost in it, my lord.

If he be now return'd,\\nAs checking at his voyage, and that he means\\nNo more to undertake it, I will work him\\nTo an exploit, now ripe in my device,\\nUnder the which he shall not choose but fall:\\nAnd for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,\\nBut even his mother shall uncharge the practise\\nAnd call it accident.\\nLAERTES\\nMy lord, I will be ruled;\\nThe rather, if you could devise it so\\nThat I might be the organ.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nIt falls right.\\nYou have been talk'd of since your travel much,\\nAnd that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality\\nWherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts\\nDid not together pluck such envy from him\\nAs did that one, and that, in my regard,\\nOf the unworthiest siege.\\nLAERTES\\nWhat part is that, my lord?\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nA very riband in the cap of youth,\\nYet needful too; for youth no less becomes\\nThe light and careless livery that it wears\\nHAMLET - Act IV\\n111Than settled age his sables and his weeds,\\nImporting health and graveness. Two months since,\\nHere was a gentleman of Normandy:--\\nI've seen myself, and served against, the French,\\nAnd they can well on horseback: but this gallant\\nHad witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;\\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse,\\nAs he had been incorpsed and demi-natured\\nWith the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,\\nThat I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,\\nCome short of what he did.\\nLAERTES\\nA Norman was't?\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nA Norman.\\nLAERTES\\nUpon my life, Lamond.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nThe very same.\\nLAERTES\\nI know him well: he is the brooch indeed\\nAnd gem of all the nation.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nHe made confession of you,\\nAnd gave you such a masterly report\\nFor art and exercise in your defence\\nAnd for your rapier most especially,\\nThat he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,\\nIf one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,\\nHe swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\\nIf you opposed them. Sir, this report of his\\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\\nYour sudden coming o'er, to play with him.\\nNow, out of this,--\\nLAERTES\\nWhat out of this, my lord?\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\\nA face without a heart?\\nHAMLET - Act IV\\n112LAERTES\\nWhy ask you this?\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nNot that I think you did not love your father;\\nBut that I know love is begun by time;\\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\\nThere lives within the very flame of love\\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;\\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still;\\nFor goodness, growing to a plurisy,\\nDies in his own too much: that we would do\\nWe should do when we would; for this 'would' changes\\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\\nAnd then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,\\nThat hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--\\nHamlet comes back: what would you undertake,\\nTo show yourself your father's son in deed\\nMore than in words?\\nLAERTES\\nTo cut his throat i' the church.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nNo place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;\\nRevenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,\\nWill you do this, keep close within your chamber.\\nHamlet return'd shall know you are come home:\\nWe'll put on those shall praise your excellence\\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\\nThe Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together\\nAnd wager on your heads: he, being remiss,\\nMost generous and free from all contriving,\\nWill not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,\\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\\nA sword unbated, and in a pass of practise\\nRequite him for your father.\\nLAERTES\\nI will do't:\\nAnd, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.\\nI bought an unction of a mountebank,\\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\\nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\\nCollected from all simples that have virtue\\nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death\\nThat is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point\\nHAMLET - Act IV\\n113With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,\\nIt may be death.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nLet's further think of this;\\nWeigh what convenience both of time and means\\nMay fit us to our shape: if this should fail,\\nAnd that our drift look through our bad performance,\\n'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project\\nShould have a back or second, that might hold,\\nIf this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:\\nWe'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.\\nWhen in your motion you are hot and dry--\\nAs make your bouts more violent to that end--\\nAnd that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him\\nA chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,\\nIf he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,\\nOur purpose may hold there.\\nEnter QUEEN GERTRUDE\\nHow now, sweet queen!\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nOne woe doth tread upon another's heel,\\nSo fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.\\nLAERTES\\nDrown'd!

For\\nhere lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,\\nit argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it\\nis, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned\\nherself wittingly.\\nSecond Clown\\nNay, but hear you, goodman delver,--\\nFirst Clown\\nGive me leave. Here lies the water; good: here\\nstands the man; good; if the man go to this water,\\nand drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he\\ngoes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him\\nand drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he\\nthat is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.\\nSecond Clown\\nBut is this law?\\nFirst Clown\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n116Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.\\nSecond Clown\\nWill you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been\\na gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'\\nChristian burial.\\nFirst Clown\\nWhy, there thou say'st: and the more pity that\\ngreat folk should have countenance in this world to\\ndrown or hang themselves, more than their even\\nChristian.

Dost know this water-fly?\\nHORATIO\\nNo, my good lord.\\nHAMLET\\nThy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to\\nknow him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a\\nbeast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at\\nthe king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,\\nspacious in the possession of dirt.\\nOSRIC\\nSweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I\\nshould impart a thing to you from his majesty.\\nHAMLET\\nI will receive it, sir, with all diligence of\\nspirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.\\nOSRIC\\nI thank your lordship, it is very hot.\\nHAMLET\\nNo, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is\\nnortherly.\\nOSRIC\\nIt is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.\\nHAMLET\\nBut yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my\\ncomplexion.\\nOSRIC\\nExceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as\\n'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his\\nmajesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a\\ngreat wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--\\nHAMLET\\nI beseech you, remember--\\nHAMLET moves him to put on his hat\\nOSRIC\\nNay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.\\nSir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe\\nme, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n130differences, of very soft society and great showing:\\nindeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or\\ncalendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the\\ncontinent of what part a gentleman would see.\\nHAMLET\\nSir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;\\nthough, I know, to divide him inventorially would\\ndizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw\\nneither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the\\nverity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of\\ngreat article; and his infusion of such dearth and\\nrareness, as, to make true diction of him, his\\nsemblable is his mirror; and who else would trace\\nhim, his umbrage, nothing more.\\nOSRIC\\nYour lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\\nHAMLET\\nThe concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman\\nin our more rawer breath?\\nOSRIC\\nSir?\\nHORATIO\\nIs't not possible to understand in another tongue?\\nYou will do't, sir, really.\\nHAMLET\\nWhat imports the nomination of this gentleman?\\nOSRIC\\nOf Laertes?\\nHORATIO\\nHis purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.\\nHAMLET\\nOf him, sir.\\nOSRIC\\nI know you are not ignorant--\\nHAMLET\\nI would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,\\nit would not much approve me. Well, sir?\\nOSRIC\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n131You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--\\nHAMLET\\nI dare not confess that, lest I should compare with\\nhim in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to\\nknow himself.\\nOSRIC\\nI mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation\\nlaid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.\\nHAMLET\\nWhat's his weapon?\\nOSRIC\\nRapier and dagger.\\nHAMLET\\nThat's two of his weapons: but, well.\\nOSRIC\\nThe king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary\\nhorses: against the which he has imponed, as I take\\nit, six French rapiers and poniards, with their\\nassigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the\\ncarriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very\\nresponsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,\\nand of very liberal conceit.\\nHAMLET\\nWhat call you the carriages?\\nHORATIO\\nI knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.\\nOSRIC\\nThe carriages, sir, are the hangers.\\nHAMLET\\nThe phrase would be more german to the matter, if we\\ncould carry cannon by our sides: I would it might\\nbe hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses\\nagainst six French swords, their assigns, and three\\nliberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet\\nagainst the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?\\nOSRIC\\nThe king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes\\nbetween yourself and him, he shall not exceed you\\nthree hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n132would come to immediate trial, if your lordship\\nwould vouchsafe the answer.\\nHAMLET\\nHow if I answer 'no'?\\nOSRIC\\nI mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.\\nHAMLET\\nSir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his\\nmajesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let\\nthe foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the\\nking hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;\\nif not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.\\nOSRIC\\nShall I re-deliver you e'en so?\\nHAMLET\\nTo this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.\\nOSRIC\\nI commend my duty to your lordship.\\nHAMLET\\nYours, yours.\\nExit OSRIC\\nHe does well to commend it himself; there are no\\ntongues else for's turn.\\nHORATIO\\nThis lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.\\nHAMLET\\nHe did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.\\nThus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I\\nknow the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of\\nthe time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of\\nyesty collection, which carries them through and\\nthrough the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do\\nbut blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.\\nEnter a Lord\\nLord\\nMy lord, his majesty commended him to you by young\\nOsric, who brings back to him that you attend him in\\nthe hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to\\nplay with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n133HAMLET\\nI am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's\\npleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now\\nor whensoever, provided I be so able as now.\\nLord\\nThe king and queen and all are coming down.\\nHAMLET\\nIn happy time.\\nLord\\nThe queen desires you to use some gentle\\nentertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.\\nHAMLET\\nShe well instructs me.\\nExit Lord\\nHORATIO\\nYou will lose this wager, my lord.\\nHAMLET\\nI do not think so: since he went into France, I\\nhave been in continual practise: I shall win at the\\nodds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here\\nabout my heart: but it is no matter.\\nHORATIO\\nNay, good my lord,--\\nHAMLET\\nIt is but foolery; but it is such a kind of\\ngain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.\\nHORATIO\\nIf your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will\\nforestall their repair hither, and say you are not\\nfit.\\nHAMLET\\nNot a whit, we defy augury: there's a special\\nprovidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,\\n'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be\\nnow; if it be not now, yet it will come: the\\nreadiness is all: since no man has aught of what he\\nleaves, what is't to leave betimes?\\nEnter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, &c\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n134KING CLAUDIUS\\nCome, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.\\nKING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's\\nHAMLET\\nGive me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;\\nBut pardon't, as you are a gentleman.\\nThis presence knows,\\nAnd you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd\\nWith sore distraction. What I have done,\\nThat might your nature, honour and exception\\nRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.\\nWas't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:\\nIf Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,\\nAnd when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,\\nThen Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.\\nWho does it, then? His madness: if't be so,\\nHamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;\\nHis madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.\\nSir, in this audience,\\nLet my disclaiming from a purposed evil\\nFree me so far in your most generous thoughts,\\nThat I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,\\nAnd hurt my brother.\\nLAERTES\\nI am satisfied in nature,\\nWhose motive, in this case, should stir me most\\nTo my revenge: but in my terms of honour\\nI stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,\\nTill by some elder masters, of known honour,\\nI have a voice and precedent of peace,\\nTo keep my name ungored. But till that time,\\nI do receive your offer'd love like love,\\nAnd will not wrong it.\\nHAMLET\\nI embrace it freely;\\nAnd will this brother's wager frankly play.\\nGive us the foils. Come on.\\nLAERTES\\nCome, one for me.\\nHAMLET\\nI'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance\\nYour skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,\\nStick fiery off indeed.\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n135LAERTES\\nYou mock me, sir.\\nHAMLET\\nNo, by this hand.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,\\nYou know the wager?\\nHAMLET\\nVery well, my lord\\nYour grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nI do not fear it; I have seen you both:\\nBut since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.\\nLAERTES\\nThis is too heavy, let me see another.\\nHAMLET\\nThis likes me well. These foils have all a length?\\nThey prepare to play\\nOSRIC\\nAy, my good lord.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nSet me the stoops of wine upon that table.\\nIf Hamlet give the first or second hit,\\nOr quit in answer of the third exchange,\\nLet all the battlements their ordnance fire:\\nThe king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;\\nAnd in the cup an union shall he throw,\\nRicher than that which four successive kings\\nIn Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;\\nAnd let the kettle to the trumpet speak,\\nThe trumpet to the cannoneer without,\\nThe cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,\\n'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:\\nAnd you, the judges, bear a wary eye.\\nHAMLET\\nCome on, sir.\\nLAERTES\\nCome, my lord.\\nThey play\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n136HAMLET\\nOne.\\nLAERTES\\nNo.\\nHAMLET\\nJudgment.\\nOSRIC\\nA hit, a very palpable hit.\\nLAERTES\\nWell; again.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nStay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;\\nHere's to thy health.\\nTrumpets sound, and cannon shot off within\\nGive him the cup.\\nHAMLET\\nI'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.\\nThey play\\nAnother hit; what say you?\\nLAERTES\\nA touch, a touch, I do confess.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nOur son shall win.\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nHe's fat, and scant of breath.\\nHere, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;\\nThe queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.\\nHAMLET\\nGood madam!\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nGertrude, do not drink.\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nI will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nAside\\nIt is the poison'd cup: it is too late.\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n137HAMLET\\nI dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nCome, let me wipe thy face.\\nLAERTES\\nMy lord, I'll hit him now.\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nI do not think't.\\nLAERTES\\nAside\\nAnd yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.\\nHAMLET\\nCome, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;\\nI pray you, pass with your best violence;\\nI am afeard you make a wanton of me.\\nLAERTES\\nSay you so? come on.\\nThey play\\nOSRIC\\nNothing, neither way.\\nLAERTES\\nHave at you now!\\nLAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nPart them; they are incensed.\\nHAMLET\\nNay, come, again.\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE falls\\nOSRIC\\nLook to the queen there, ho!\\nHORATIO\\nThey bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?\\nOSRIC\\nHow is't, Laertes?\\nLAERTES\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n138Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;\\nI am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.\\nHAMLET\\nHow does the queen?\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nShe swounds to see them bleed.\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE\\nNo, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--\\nThe drink, the drink! I am poison'd.\\nDies\\nHAMLET\\nO villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:\\nTreachery! Seek it out.\\nLAERTES\\nIt is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;\\nNo medicine in the world can do thee good;\\nIn thee there is not half an hour of life;\\nThe treacherous instrument is in thy hand,\\nUnbated and envenom'd: the foul practise\\nHath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,\\nNever to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:\\nI can no more: the king, the king's to blame.\\nHAMLET\\nThe point!--envenom'd too!\\nThen, venom, to thy work.\\nStabs KING CLAUDIUS\\nAll\\nTreason! treason!\\nKING CLAUDIUS\\nO, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.\\nHAMLET\\nHere, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,\\nDrink off this potion. Is thy union here?\\nFollow my mother.\\nKING CLAUDIUS dies\\nLAERTES\\nHe is justly served;\\nIt is a poison temper'd by himself.\\nExchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:\\nMine and my father's death come not upon thee,\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n139Nor thine on me.\\nDies\\nHAMLET\\nHeaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.\\nI am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!\\nYou that look pale and tremble at this chance,\\nThat are but mutes or audience to this act,\\nHad I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,\\nIs strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--\\nBut let it be. Horatio, I am dead;\\nThou livest; report me and my cause aright\\nTo the unsatisfied.\\nHORATIO\\nNever believe it:\\nI am more an antique Roman than a Dane:\\nHere's yet some liquor left.\\nHAMLET\\nAs thou'rt a man,\\nGive me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.\\nO good Horatio, what a wounded name,\\nThings standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!\\nIf thou didst ever hold me in thy heart\\nAbsent thee from felicity awhile,\\nAnd in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,\\nTo tell my story.\\nMarch afar off, and shot within\\nWhat warlike noise is this?\\nOSRIC\\nYoung Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,\\nTo the ambassadors of England gives\\nThis warlike volley.\\nHAMLET\\nO, I die, Horatio;\\nThe potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:\\nI cannot live to hear the news from England;\\nBut I do prophesy the election lights\\nOn Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;\\nSo tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,\\nWhich have solicited. The rest is silence.\\nDies\\nHORATIO\\nNow cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:\\nAnd flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n140Why does the drum come hither?\\nMarch within\\nEnter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others\\nPRINCE FORTINBRAS\\nWhere is this sight?\\nHORATIO\\nWhat is it ye would see?\\nIf aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.\\nPRINCE FORTINBRAS\\nThis quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,\\nWhat feast is toward in thine eternal cell,\\nThat thou so many princes at a shot\\nSo bloodily hast struck?\\nFirst Ambassador\\nThe sight is dismal;\\nAnd our affairs from England come too late:\\nThe ears are senseless that should give us hearing,\\nTo tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,\\nThat Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:\\nWhere should we have our thanks?\\nHORATIO\\nNot from his mouth,\\nHad it the ability of life to thank you:\\nHe never gave commandment for their death.\\nBut since, so jump upon this bloody question,\\nYou from the Polack wars, and you from England,\\nAre here arrived give order that these bodies\\nHigh on a stage be placed to the view;\\nAnd let me speak to the yet unknowing world\\nHow these things came about: so shall you hear\\nOf carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,\\nOf accidental judgments, casual slaughters,\\nOf deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,\\nAnd, in this upshot, purposes mistook\\nFall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I\\nTruly deliver.\\nPRINCE FORTINBRAS\\nLet us haste to hear it,\\nAnd call the noblest to the audience.\\nFor me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:\\nI have some rights of memory in this kingdom,\\nWhich now to claim my vantage doth invite me.\\nHORATIO\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n141Of that I shall have also cause to speak,\\nAnd from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;\\nBut let this same be presently perform'd,\\nEven while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance\\nOn plots and errors, happen.\\nPRINCE FORTINBRAS\\nLet four captains\\nBear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;\\nFor he was likely, had he been put on,\\nTo have proved most royally: and, for his passage,\\nThe soldiers' music and the rites of war\\nSpeak loudly for him.\\nTake up the bodies: such a sight as this\\nBecomes the field, but here shows much amiss.\\nGo, bid the soldiers shoot.\\nA dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off\\nHAMLET - Act V\\n142\""

    "The transform_comments function converts comments in a Python script into those usable by a C compiler. This means looking for text that begins with a hash mark (#) and replacing it with double slashes (//), which is the C single-line comment indicator. For the purpose of this exercise, we'll ignore the possibility of a hash mark embedded inside of a Python command, and assume that it's only used to indicate a comment. We also want to treat repetitive hash marks (##), (###), etc., as a single comment indicator, to be replaced with just (//) and not (#//) or (//#). Fill in the parameters of the substitution method to complete this function: "
